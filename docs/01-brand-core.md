# 1. Brand Core

## Positioning Statement

I help bootstrapped nontechnical founders and domain experts turn ambitious ideas into software that users love.

## Mission

Make high-quality product execution accessible to bootstrapped nontechnical founders—so more ambitious ideas actually ship, help users, and move the world forward.

## Vision

Help 100 bootstrapped non-technical founders create their ambitious ideas into their first product that users love.

## Core Values

- **Clarity** – plain language, visible roadmap, no black boxes.  
- **Momentum** – bias toward shipping real software over perfect plans.  
- **Candor** – honest trade-offs, no fluff, reality > hype.

- **Resourcefulness** – making the most of limited time and budget, maximizing impact per dollar.
- **Risk-Free Partnership** – I shoulder the risk so founders can move fast: every service tier comes with a clear, time-boxed guarantee spelled out in the offer.
