## Service Packages

### Build Fast

**What’s Included:**

- **Prototype Sprint** – In **7 business days**, we’ll build a live demo of your core feature so you can show it to real users.
- **Live Product Build** – Over **4–6 weeks**, we’ll turn that demo into a working product with signup (and payment flow if you need it), so you can start collecting feedback or even revenue.
- **Live Launch Setup** – We’ll get your product online—buying the hosting, setting up deployment, and making sure it stays up.
- **Optional Check-In Call** – A 2-hour strategy session to review what’s built and plan next steps.

**Deliverables:**

- **Live Prototype Link**  
	- A shareable URL to test and demo your core feature in action.
- **Live Product**  
	- A fully functional site/app ready for real users or paying customers.
- **Project Handoff Kit**  
	- A clear, step-by-step package so you or any future developer can seamlessly take over the project
	- Includes:
		- Description of the project and key decisions made
	    - Overview of the code structure and key components
	    - Instructions for setting up hosting and deployments
		- No dev team required. Everything’s built so you can iterate, show investors, or hand off cleanly.
- **Optional Check-In Call**  
	- A 2-hour strategy session to review what’s built and plan next steps.

**Average Duration:** 5–7 weeks

**Guarantee:** Live & User-Ready or Money Back
If we don't deliver a working product that real users can sign up for and use, I'll refund your entire investment. Period.

**_Outcome**:_ You’ll end up with a live, user-ready product that you can show, test, and start turning into real traction—without needing to touch  servers or write a single line of code.
