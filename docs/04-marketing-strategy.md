## Audience & Core Messaging

### Ideal Client Profile

Bootstrapped revenue‑focused nontechnical founders and domain experts who:
- Have ambitious product ideas but limited technical bandwidth **and limited budgets**
- Prioritise profit, sustainability, and fast iteration over fundraising
- Need a hands‑on partner to translate vision into software users will pay for


**Key Message Pillars**
