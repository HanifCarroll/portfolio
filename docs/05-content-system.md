# 5. Content System

## Purpose & Principles (Lean Edition)

- **Founder‑First Focus:** Every piece answers a real bootstrapped‑founder pain.
- **Keystone First:** One core asset (weekly newsletter) drives all other outputs.
- **1‑Hour Rule:** Content work fits into a single 60‑min block each weekday (≈ 5 hrs/week).
- **Repurpose > Reinvent:** Each newsletter spawns LinkedIn, X, and future blog assets.
- **Iterate on Data:** Engagement + call bookings steer future topics.

## Core Asset

### Newsletter · _The Bootstrapped Founder’s Field Guide_

- **Objective:** Deepen trust, save founders time, fuel the marketing flywheel.
- **Cadence:** Weekly (created on Tue · polished & scheduled on Wed).
- **Issue Template:**
    1. **Hook & Lesson** (250‑300 words)
    2. **Curated Picks** (3 links + 1‑line commentary)
    3. **Ask Hanif** (invite replies, 40‑60 words)
    4. **Soft CTA** (book strategy session or share)
- **Curation Rules:** relevance, actionability, brevity, non‑competitive, one‑link‑per‑domain.
