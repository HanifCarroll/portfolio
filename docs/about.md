I started programming in 2017 when I decided that physical therapy school wasn’t for me. 

I’ve worked at a large consulting company (Capgemini) and at a medium size startup (LeagueApps) (joined at 75 people, left at 150).

After leaving LeagueApps, I started freelancing in website development as well as web app development, making websites for people and landing a position as a fractional CTO for a social events app. I also developed two apps, one a SaaS that turns coach or consultant client call transcripts into generated and scheduled LinkedIn Posts, and the other a platform to facilitate small group in-person language exchanges in the city of Buenos Aires.

After freelancing, I’ve learned that I do better with the light structure of a startup environment. It’s within that structure that I can really flourish and push myself to perform.

I’m most comfortable with Typescript, but I’m up to the challenge of learning any language or framework.

I don’t like staying in the “engineering” box. I like considering the UX and the product strategy as well. I like hearing about how users are enjoying the product and what changes they want. I like deeply understanding the user persona and his use cases and giving him what he wants in the form of an exceptional product. I like learning about product, marketing, and sales.

In my free time, I like to workout (I’ve been lifting weights for almost 20 years and my best lifts are a 500 pound squat, 405 pound bench, and a 620 pound deadlift) and play ultimate frisbee. I also love to read and listen to podcasts and audio books. I like socializing and connecting with people, having run a social community in Buenos Aires for almost 3 years. I also love to write, and I recently started a habit of writing every day to improve my writing. Clear thinking and communication are very important to me.

I’m obsessed with the question of how we can use AI to perform better, not just in the domain of software engineering, but in our lives in general.

I’m looking for a role in an early stage startup (pre-seed to series B, 10-50 people), one that’s small enough for me to have a big impact. 

I want to do full-stack development, ideally with some product or marketing input so that I can grow in those areas.

I want to be a part of a team that I can learn from and be inspired by. 

I want to be a part of an ambitious organization, one that wants to make the word a better place, not just sell more ads.

I like working on products that empower people, whether it allows them to do something they couldn’t before or it allows them to do an important task more easily. Bonus points if the product brings people together and reinforces connections between people.
