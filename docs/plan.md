### **2. The Core Offer: "The Digital Showroom"**

This is *what* you sell.

* **Service:** Custom-coded, high-performance websites built with Next.js.

### **3. The Ideal Client Profile (ICP)**

This is *who* you sell to.

* **Client Archetype:** Small Business Owners, Creative Professionals, and ambitious Entrepreneurs.
* **Their Business:** They sell something that needs to be seen to be valued (e.g., design, architecture, art, high-end crafts, consulting results).
* **Their Core Problem:** Their online presence is either non-existent or amateur, failing to reflect the high quality of their work. This causes them to lose business to more established competitors.
* **Concrete Examples:** Interior designers, architects, photographers, boutique agencies, high-end furniture makers, artists.

### **4. The Portfolio & Proof Strategy**

This is *how* you prove your value.

* **Narrative Framework:** Every project in the portfolio will be presented as a concise case study using the **Problem -> Solution -> Result** format.
* **Focus:** The language will emphasize business outcomes (e.g., "built instant credibility," "acts as their best salesperson") over technical features.
* **Positioning:** The portfolio is curated to tell one story: you are an expert at building "Digital Showrooms" for the ICP. Non-related projects (like the Wikipedia tool) will be kept in a separate "Labs" section.
