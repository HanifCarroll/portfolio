Problem: The artist had a vast and impressive body of work scattered across various social media platforms. Lacking a central, professional hub, he was missing opportunities from editors and publishers who couldn't easily view his portfolio or gauge his professionalism.

Solution: We built his "Professional Portfolio Hub"â€”a custom Next.js website designed to let the art be the hero. The site was engineered for speed and visual clarity, featuring categorized galleries for sequential art, covers, and character designs. This allowed industry professionals to navigate his work efficiently.

Result: The artist now has a polished, professional online presence that matches the high quality of his artwork. The site acts as his digital resume, giving him the confidence to pitch to major publishers and making it simple for editors to commission him for high-profile projects.
