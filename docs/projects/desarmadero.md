Client: Automotive "Desarmadero" (Auto Parts Supplier)

Problem: The business managed a massive, constantly-changing inventory of auto parts. Customers had no way to check stock other than calling or visiting, which consumed hours of staff time in repetitive phone calls and led to lost sales.

Solution: We created a "Digital Stockroom"â€”a custom, searchable online inventory system. The platform featured a simple back-end for staff to upload new vehicles and a powerful front-end for customers to search for vehicles by make, model, and year. Each listing included photos and a direct inquiry form.

Result: The system dramatically increased operational efficiency by reducing repetitive phone inquiries. Customers can now browse the entire inventory 24/7, leading to a higher volume of qualified, specific sales leads and transforming the business's ability to serve its market.
