Client: Beauty Brand Entrepreneur

Problem: A pair of entrepreneurs had a promising idea for a new line of beauty products but faced a significant financial risk. Before investing in costly product development and inventory, they needed to validate whether there was real market demand.

Solution: We developed a "Market Validation Platform"â€”a high-fidelity, convincing e-commerce storefront built with Next.js. The site showcased the proposed product line and allowed users to add items to a cart. At the final "purchase" step, it collected an email for a "pre-launch list" instead of payment, effectively testing purchase intent.

Result: The entrepreneur successfully gauged market interest with minimal financial exposure. The test identified the most popular products and generated a valuable email list of early adopters, providing the crucial data and confidence needed to proceed with a targeted, successful product launch.
