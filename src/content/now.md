  they asked what I'm focused on right now.

## Fitness

Now that I'm mostly injury-free, I'm focused on getting my strength back to where it was ages ago. My goal for 2026 is to hit PRs for all of my strength lifts (squat, bench, deadlift, press, pull ups, etc). I recently deadlifted [220kg for 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0yXk9r5UTg), which is more than I thought I'd be able to. I'm confident that in 2026 I'll be able to beat my PR of 282kg for 1.
## Genrupt

Genrupt, the AI video generation platform that I'm developing, is coming along. We've recently added subscriptions and organizations, and we're starting to onboard more users.

## Social Mood

Throughout the year, I go through cycles where I go from feeling less social to more. I've recently started a more social part of the cycle, which has perfectly coincided with the summer here in Buenos Aires.
