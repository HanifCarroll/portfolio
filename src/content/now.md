This is a "now page" inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://nownownow.com/about).
It's what I'd tell a friend if they asked what I'm focused on right now.

## Fitness

I discovered what was causing the majority of my knee pain (weak tibialis anterior), and I'm feeling better than I have in a long time. I'm able to sprint 100% while playing ultimate, and I'm also getting back into doing squats, deadlifts, and cleans.

I underestimated how much these injuries were bringing down my mood and motivation.

## Leaving Buenos Aires

After a lot of careful consideration, I've decided it's time to leave Buenos Aires, and I'll be leaving in March of next year to go back to the US. I'll always be grateful for how much this city has changed me for the better.
