  they asked what I'm focused on right now.

## BA Eventos

I built an AI-powered event discovery platform for Buenos Aires called [BA Eventos](https://baeventos.com). It aggregates events from Passline, Eventbrite, Meetup, and other sources, then lets users search and discover events through natural language conversation. Built with Claude AI, semantic search via pgvector, and agent-native architecture—17 tools that give the AI full parity with the UI.

## Genrupt

Still working with Genrupt, an AI video/image generation platform for e-commerce. Recently shipped a Canva-style text editing feature: Google Vision OCR detects text on product images, AI inpainting removes it, then users can add branded text with automatic font classification. Also built out batch processing for handling multiple images in a pipeline.

## Fitness

Knees are finally healing after discovering sissy squats. No more pain going downstairs, which means I can actually do cardio again. Goal for 2026 is to hit PRs on all my lifts—recently deadlifted 220kg for 5, aiming to beat my 282kg single.

## Life in Buenos Aires

I was planning to move back to the US in April, but then I got into a relationship and decided to stay. Summer is in full swing and I'm enjoying it.
