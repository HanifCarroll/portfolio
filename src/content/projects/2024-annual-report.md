## Transforming Annual Reporting: Lightbearers 2024

Lightbearers, a US-based ministry organization, sought to move beyond a traditional static annual report for their 2024 accomplishments. Their goal was to present their yearly impact in a more engaging, accessible, and dynamic way to their supporters and the wider community.

## Custom Development for an Interactive Experience

My role was to develop this vision into a fully interactive online annual report. This involved custom coding a responsive and engaging web experience from the ground up using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. Key development features focused on bringing their story to life, including:

-   **Intuitive Navigation:** Ensuring users can easily explore different sections of the report.
-   **Embedded Multimedia:** Integrating images and animations seamlessly to enrich the content.
-   **Interactive Calls-to-Action:** Encouraging deeper engagement and response from readers.
-   **Engaging Timeline Feature:** Visually narrating their year's journey and key milestones.

## Enhanced Engagement & Accessibility

The result is a digital annual report that fundamentally transforms how Lightbearers communicates its yearly impact. This custom-coded solution offers a far more engaging and accessible experience than a traditional PDF, presenting complex information beautifully and effectively online. This project highlights my expertise in custom front-end development to create compelling online narratives that capture attention and clearly convey an organization's achievements.
