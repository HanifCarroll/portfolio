The Chat App Homepage project began as a concept to explore modern UI/UX patterns for messaging platforms. My goal was to create a visually engaging and intuitive landing page that could serve as the entry point for a full-featured chat application. I started by researching current trends in chat and collaboration tools, focusing on clean layouts, accessible color schemes, and clear calls to action.

After sketching initial ideas, I moved into Figma to design the interface, iterating on layout, typography, and iconography. The design emphasizes simplicity and ease of use, with prominent sign-up and demo buttons, a hero section that communicates the appâ€™s value, and a responsive layout that adapts seamlessly to different devices.

Once the design was finalized, I built the homepage in Webflow, leveraging its visual development tools to translate the Figma mockups into a live, interactive site. The result is a polished, production-ready homepage that demonstrates both my design and front-end development skills, and serves as a strong foundation for future expansion of the chat app concept.
