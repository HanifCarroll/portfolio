## Concept Project: Designing & Building a Chat App Landing Page

This project involved redesigning and building a landing page for a fictional chat application. While a conceptual exercise, it served as a valuable opportunity to hone specific skills crucial for delivering effective landing pages for client projects: adapting design ideas, integrating various assets, and utilizing powerful tools like Figma and Webflow.

## Process & Skills Showcased

-   **Design Adaptation (Figma):** Starting with an existing concept, I put my own design spin on the layout and user experience within Figma. This demonstrates the ability to iterate on visual ideas and tailor designs to specific goals.
-   **Asset Integration:** The project required sourcing and thoughtfully integrating diverse visual assets – including stock photos and UI mockups – ensuring they worked cohesively. This mirrors real-world projects where harmonizing different visual elements is key.
-   **Webflow Development:** The finalized design was built using Webflow. This exercise reinforced my ability to translate Figma designs into pixel-perfect, functional websites, leveraging Webflow's visual interface for efficient development based on solid CSS principles.

## Outcome & Relevance for Clients

This concept project sharpened my end-to-end workflow for creating engaging landing pages, from initial design concepts in Figma to final development in Webflow. It demonstrates core capabilities in visual design, asset management, and proficiency with key industry tools, ensuring I can effectively bring marketing page concepts and other web designs to life for your business.
