Designed and developed a responsive online catalogue for an auto salvage yard using Webflow & its CMS. Customers now easily browse and search complex inventory on any device via a user-friendly interface. Solved the client's need for an easy-to-update, professional online presence for their parts inventory. Demonstrates my ability to create practical, data-driven Webflow sites that improve customer experience and meet specific business goals.
