## Creating a Central Hub for the 'Dwell' Convocation

For their multi-day 'Dwell' Convocation event, Lightbearers needed a dedicated landing page to serve as the central information source for attendees. The key challenge was organizing extensive details—including multi-day schedules, speaker bios, venue information, accommodation options, and comprehensive FAQs—into a clear, accessible, and user-friendly online format.

## Custom Development for Clarity and Detail

I developed this comprehensive landing page using custom HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. This approach allowed for precise control over the layout to effectively manage the large amount of content and ensure seamless integration with the main Lightbearers website. The development focused on creating a logical information architecture, making it easy for users to navigate distinct sections covering:

-   Event Purpose & Theme
-   Speaker Profiles
-   Detailed Day-by-Day Schedule
-   Venue Specifics (including maps)
-   Accommodation Recommendations
-   Frequently Asked Questions

The page was built to be fully responsive, providing an optimal viewing experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

## Outcome: An Informative & User-Friendly Resource

The resulting landing page provided attendees with a clear, efficient, and single point of reference for all 'Dwell' event information. It successfully handled complex content, enhancing the attendee experience by making crucial details readily accessible. This project showcases my ability to develop custom, well-structured web pages specifically designed to present complex information clearly and professionally – ideal for events, programs, or detailed informational campaigns.
