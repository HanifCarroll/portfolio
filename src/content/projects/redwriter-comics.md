## Bringing a Unique Vision Online

REDWRITER Comics needed a portfolio website as distinctive as their artwork. The challenge was translating their highly original, unconventional design concept into a fully responsive and intuitive WordPress experience, especially concerning overlapping interactive elements which could confuse users.

## Custom Solutions for a Unique Design

Using WordPress as a foundation, I wrote custom HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP to build the unique design. Key solutions included:

-   **Solving UX Challenges:** To prevent confusion with overlapping interactive banners, I refined the interaction â€“ only specific arrow icons are clickable, guided by a subtle glow animation for clarity.
-   **Purposeful Animation:** Tasteful animations using GSAP were added to inject brand personality (like a section zoom and subtle object movements) while ensuring they enhanced, rather than distracted from, the user experience.

## The Result: A Standout Digital Presence

The outcome is a captivating and responsive portfolio that effectively showcases REDWRITER Comics' creative work and truly captures their unique brand identity online. This project highlights my ability to deliver custom WordPress solutions, tackle complex responsive layouts and UX problems, and implement engaging, purposeful animations.
