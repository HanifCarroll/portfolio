  "problem": "Entrepreneurs had a promising beauty product idea but faced significant financial risk. They needed to validate market demand before investing in costly development and inventory.",
  "solution": "We developed a \"Market Validation Platform\"â€”a high-fidelity, convincing e-commerce storefront built with Next.js. The site showcased the proposed product line and allowed users to add items to a cart. At the final \"purchase\" step, it collected an email for a \"pre-launch list\" instead of payment, effectively testing purchase intent.",
  "result": "The entrepreneur successfully gauged market interest with minimal financial exposure. The test identified the most popular products and generated a valuable email list of early adopters, providing the crucial data and confidence needed to proceed with a targeted, successful product launch.",
