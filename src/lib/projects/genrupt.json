  "problem": [
    "The founder had built a functional MVP but faced technical debt and scalability challenges. The codebase needed architectural improvements for the cost management system, refactoring for maintainability, and new features to support multiple AI providers efficiently.",
    "As the product scaled, these technical foundations became critical bottlenecks."
  ],
  "solution": [
    "Provided technical consultation and hands-on implementation across key areas of the platform. Helped architect the database-driven cost configuration system enabling instant pricing updates without deployment.",
    "Implemented the pending cost pattern with two-phase commit ensuring users never charged for failed AI operations. Refactored core features for improved maintainability and extensibility.",
    "Built new functionality supporting multi-provider AI orchestration with intelligent fallback logic, and contributed to the poll-based async architecture handling long video generation times."
  ],
  "result": [
    "Strengthened platform's technical foundations through strategic architectural improvements and targeted refactoring. The database-driven cost system now enables rapid pricing experimentation without code changes. Pay-for-success billing pattern eliminates customer support issues around failed operations.",
    "Refactored codebase improved team velocity for future feature development. Multi-provider orchestration increased reliability through automatic failover. Demonstrated ability to quickly understand complex codebases, identify high-impact improvements, and deliver production-ready solutions."
