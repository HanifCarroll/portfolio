  "problem": [
    "Language exchange platforms either feel like dating apps with endless profile swiping, or massive party events where meaningful conversation is impossible.",
    "Learners want focused practice with real people, but existing solutions prioritize profiles over practice and quantity over quality."
  ],
  "solution": [
    "Built HablaBA as a local-first platform that limits exchanges to 6 people maximum, enables neighborhood-based discovery across 48 Buenos Aires neighborhoods, and facilitates coordination through real-time group chat.",
    "Developed both web (Laravel + Vue) and mobile (Flutter) applications sharing the same backend API, with WebSocket-powered real-time features and comprehensive authentication including 2FA."
  ],
  "result": [
    "Created a production-ready platform with sophisticated features including AI-powered compatibility scoring (90% interest match + 10% time availability), real-time chat with optimistic UI updates, multi-step profile onboarding with draft persistence, and comprehensive push notification system.",
    "The platform demonstrates advanced full-stack capabilities across web and mobile, with emphasis on user-centric product decisions and scalable architecture."
