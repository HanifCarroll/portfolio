  "description": "A premium digital showroom for an interior designer, featuring high-resolution galleries and streamlined consultation booking to attract high-value clients.",
  "client": "Independent Interior Designer",
  "service": "Custom Portfolio Development",
  "year": "2024",
  "technologies": ["Next.js", "TypeScript", "Tailwind CSS"],
  "liveUrl": "https://maximo-interiorismo.netlify.app/",
  "problem": "The designer's exceptional work was invisible online. Lacking a professional website, he was losing high-value clients who couldn't find or verify his portfolio, limiting his business growth to word-of-mouth and an outdated social media presence.",
  "solution": "We designed and built his \"Digital Showroom\"â€”a custom, high-performance Next.js website engineered to reflect the premium quality of his work. The focus was on a fast, visually-immersive experience. Key elements included a filterable, high-resolution project gallery and clear pathways for potential clients to book a consultation.",
  "result": "He now possesses a professional online hub that builds instant credibility. It acts as his best salesperson, allowing him to confidently pitch larger projects and convert prospects who are actively seeking high-end interior design services.",
