# About Me

## My Journey

### Early Life and Education

Most of my life has been spent in Florida, growing up in a small city on its west coast. My academic path led me to the University of South Florida, where I studied health sciences. The plan was to pursue physical therapy and eventually open a gym to help athletes perform better.

### Career Pivot

However, before entering a program, it became clear that this wouldn't be a very fulfilling path for me. A bit later, programming entered the picture and quickly became a passion. Self-teaching led to a job in tech, and the industry has been home ever since.

### Language Learning

I had always been interested in languages, having studied a bit of Japanese, Mandarin Chinese, German, and Turkish. Spanish became my new pursuit during the pandemic. After almost two years of study, a two-month trip to Mexico City put those skills to the test and opened the door to a fascination with life in Latin America.

### Finding Home in Buenos Aires

A long-standing desire to live in a big city inspired visits to some of the largest in Latin America—Medellin, Bogota, Lima, and Buenos Aires. Buenos Aires stood out in spectacular fashion, thanks to its vibrant social energy, which was exactly what was needed for the next phase of life.

Nearly three years have passed in Buenos Aires, bringing countless reasons for gratitude. The city has been a powerful teacher, helping me to grow beyond expectations and offering connections with incredible people.

## My Values

### Individuation

My life is guided by Carl Jung's concept of individuation—the process of becoming a distinct, individual entity, separate from the collective. This philosophy inspires a search for personal potential and a deep belief in the power of tight-knit communities as sources of meaning. Strong communities, after all, are built by individuals who embrace what makes them unique.

### Well-being

I do things that make me feel good and avoid things that make me feel bad, but not in a purely hedonistic sense. For example, working out makes me feel good, while lying or eating poorly does not. Fulfillment and inner peace come more easily when well-being is prioritized.

### Simplicity

Simplicity is another guiding principle of mine, both in life and in design. Lessons from software engineering reinforce the value of keeping things simple whenever possible. Gall's law states that complex systems that work evolve from simple systems that worked, which serves as a reminder that complexity can't be designed from scratch.

## My Interests

### Connection

Connecting with others and sharing ideas is a source of joy, as is teaching and learning. This mutual exchange supports self-discovery and growth for everyone involved.

My interest in bringing people together and creating spaces for connection stems from a belief in the essential role of community in a meaningful life.

### Fitness

Physical activity is a big part of daily life, with nearly 20 years of weightlifting, along with ultimate frisbee, flag football, dancing, running, and yoga.

### User Experience

User Experience is a topic that I often think about. Empathy has always been a strength of mine, making UX a natural interest. My long-term goal is to create a software studio with a portfolio of digital products that people love to use. This connects directly to my belief in helping people discover their potential—a well designed product can empower users to be their authentic selves.

### Philosophy

It wasn't until about a year ago that I realized that I've been going through life trying to answer the question "how can I live a good life?" I've learned about philosophy, psychology, religion, and spirituality with this question burning in the back of my mind.
