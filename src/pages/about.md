## About Me

### My Journey

I lived almost all of my life inside of the state Florida, having grown up in a small city on its west coast.

I went to school at the University of South Florida where I studied health sciences. After graduating, I had planned on studying physical therapy with the goal of opening a gym where I could help athletes perform better. Before getting into a program, though, I realized that I wasn’t going to be happy following that path. A bit later, I started learning about programming, and I fell in love with it. From there, I self-taught my way to a job, and I’ve been in the tech industry ever since.

I started learning Spanish during the pandemic. Almost 2 years later, I felt ready to put my skills to the test, so I took a 2 month trip to Mexico City. That experience opened my eyes to a new world, and I became fascinated with the idea of living in Latin America.

I always wanted to live in a big city, so I visited some of the biggest in Latin America (Medellin, Bogota, Lima, and Buenos Aires) to find my new home; Buenos Aires won in spectacular fashion. I fell in love with the social energy of the city, which was exactly what I needed for the next phase of my life.

It’s been almost 3 years since I’ve been here in Buenos Aires, and I have much to be thankful for. The city has taught me a lot about myself and helped me to grow far beyond what I thought possible. I’m eternally grateful to the city and the people I’ve met here.

### My Values

I live my life guided by Carl Jung's concept of individuation—the process of becoming a distinct, individual entity, separate from the collective. As a result, I believe that our purpose is to discover our potential, to understand who we really are. I also believe in the power of tight-knit community as a source of meaning in our lives and that a strong community is made up of individuals that embrace their individuality.

I do things that make me feel good and avoid things that make me feel bad, but not in a purely hedonistic sense. For example, working out makes me feel good, so I do it. Lying or eating a diet based on McDonald's don't make me feel good, so I don't do them. It’s easier to live a life that’s fulfilling when you feel good, and I consider it a prerequisite to inner peace.

I live with simplicity in mind. If I've learned anything from design and software engineering, it's that things should be kept simple when possible. A corollary, or perhaps a reason for the effectiveness of simplicity, is Gall's law, which states that complex systems that work have invariably evolved from simple systems that worked—complexity can't be designed from scratch.

### My Interests

I love connecting with other people and sharing ideas, and I enjoy teaching as much as I enjoy learning. This mutual exchange helps both parties in their journey of self-discovery and growth.

I love bringing people together and creating spaces for people to connect, which stems from my belief that tight-knit communities are essential sources of meaning in our lives.

I love working out. I've been lifting weights for almost 20 years, and I love playing ultimate frisbee and flag football. I also enjoy dancing and doing a bit of running and yoga.

I think a lot about User Experience. I've always been a very empathetic person, so it was only a matter of time before I became interested in UX design. My expertise as a UX Engineer puts me in a good position to achieve a goal of mine: creating a software studio with a portfolio of digital products that people love to use. This connects directly to my belief in helping people discover their potential—a well designed product can empower users to be their authentic selves.

It wasn't until about a year ago that I realized that I've been going through life trying to answer the question "how can I live a good life?" I've learned about philosophy, psychology, religion, and spirituality with this question burning in the back of my mind.
