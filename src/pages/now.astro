                <p>
                    Inspired by a great interaction I recently had, I've opened
                    my calendar for informal virtual coffees! No agenda
                    necessary. Just two curious people chatting, seeing what we
                    can discover together.

                <p>
                    I decided to start a new side project: a mobile app for
                    people in Buenos Aires, Argentina to find other people for
                    language exchanges. The idea is that they use the app to
                    find people interested in practicing their language skills,
                    then they coordinate to meet up in person.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm developing it Lean Startup style, aiming for fast
                    iterations and getting feedback as quickly as I can.

                <p>
                    Every day, I dedicate a bit of time to practicing my Spanish
                    by reading aloud and by listening to audio books, podcasts,
                    or YouTube videos. I've been doing this for about 5 weeks,
                    and it's surprising how much more fluent I feel.

                <p>
                    I'm having a great time learning more about Eastern
                    Philosophies, specifically Taoism and Buddhism. Currently
                    reading Alan Watt's Tao: The Watercourse Way in Spanish.
