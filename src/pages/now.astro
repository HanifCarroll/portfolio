                        I'm actively seeking a full-stack product engineer role at
                        an early-stage startup (pre-seed to Series B, 10–50 people).
                        I'm looking to join a mission-driven team building products that
                        empower people and brings them together.

                        I've been interested in copywriting for a while, and I've finally decided to learn more about it. Just finished reading The Boron Letters by Gary Halbert, and I'm currently reading The Adweek Copywriting Handbook by Joseph Sugarman.

                        At the same time, I'm also learning about sales funnels as I listen to Dotcom Secrets by Russell Brunson. My plan is to listen to all of the books in the trilogy.

                        Finally recovering from some leg injuries and getting back into shape. I'm also getting back into playing ultimate frisbee competitively after having joined a team a few months ago.

                        I'm spending more time on X (Twitter) as I find my voice and learn to express myself more confidently. I'm amazed by how much you can learn from the diverse voices on the platform—from VCs to builders to scientists.
