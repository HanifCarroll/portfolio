# What I'm Up To

(This is [a now page](https://nownownow.com/about), and if you have your own site, consider adding a now page to it.)

## From Engineer to Product Engineer

After careful reflection, I've decided to set my sights on new career goals. My long term goal is to create a software studio that makes apps that connect people and make their lives better. My shorter term goal is to start freelancing with startups on product development. I've realied that I'm pretty good at thinking about UX as well as using AI to build products more efficiently, so I'd like to offer those gifts to the world.

## Learning Russian

I recently started learning Russian. It's a language that always interested me, but I finally decided to invest some time into it due to all of the interactions I've had with Russian speaking people here in Buenos Aires. Being able to use a language is a big motivator to learn it. One thing surprised me: the alphabet wasn't as hard to learn as I thought it would be!

## Scheduling Virtual Coffee Chats

Inspired by a great interaction I recently had, I've opened my calendar for informal virtual coffees! No agenda necessary. Just two curious people chatting, seeing what we can discover together.

_(If you can’t find a suitable time, send me an email and we’ll work it out.)_

## New Mobile App Project

I decided to start a new side project: a mobile app for people in Buenos Aires, Argentina to find other people for language exchanges. The idea is that they use the app to find people interested in practicing their language skills, then they coordinate to meet up in person.

MVP development has been going well. I've got the React Native mobile app in a decent spot, and now I'm going to start building out the server. I hope to have it in the app stores before the end of August.
