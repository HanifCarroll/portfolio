# What I'm Up To

_This is [a now page](https://nownownow.com/about), and if you have your own site, consider adding a now page to it._

_Last Updated July 31st, 2025_

## Building a Technical Product Expert Practice

I've shifted my focus from pure development to becoming a Technical Product Expert. My goal is to help agencies and businesses build products that users genuinely love by combining user research, strategic thinking, and full-stack development.

I'm currently accepting new clients for prototype development, MVP builds, and custom websites. The vision is to eventually create a software studio that makes apps that connect people and improve their lives.

## Learning Russian

I recently started learning Russian after countless interactions with Russian speakers here in Buenos Aires. Having people to practice with makes all the difference in language learning motivation. 

One pleasant surprise: the Cyrillic alphabet wasn't nearly as intimidating as I expected!

## Buenos Aires Language Exchange App

I'm developing a mobile app to help people in Buenos Aires find language exchange partners. The concept is simple: match people who want to practice different languages, then help them coordinate in-person meetups.

The React Native app is progressing well, and I'm currently building the backend infrastructure. Planning to launch in the app stores soon.

## Open Calendar for Coffee Chats

Inspired by several great conversations, I've opened my calendar for informal virtual coffees. No agenda requiredâ€”just two curious people exploring ideas together.
