narrativeRole: Closes the loop with two concrete, low-hype next actions — read the case study, run the live demo — inviting inspection rather than selling a result.
keyMessage: The transparent routing system is open for inspection: read the case study or explore the live demo.

Blueprint-shape note: a calm end-card — 2–3 near-still closing phrases hard-cut in sequence, terminating on the held ask (Adapt keeps the restrained card-chain signature; low motion is the confidence). Closing treatment: centered, concentric rings, one cobalt CTA.
Scene 1 (0.0–1.6s): light-gray ground with faint **concentric closing-rings** (closing atmosphere, centered) + a thin cobalt `accent-line` (60×4) above an ink `h2` — "Routing you can open." — via **waterfall-entry** (`waterfall-entry`, smooth `power3`). Only the headline enters at t=0; nothing else yet.
Scene 2 (1.6–3.8s): as the VO names the actions, two flat white 6px cards stack center — "Open the case study" (anchored by `assets/policy.png` thumbnail + the `decision-packet` evidence, on "case study" ≈2.0s) and "Explore the live demo" (anchored by `assets/live-full-page.png` thumbnail, on "live demo" ≈2.9s) — each entering via **spring-pop entrance** (`spring-pop-entrance`) on its own spoken cue, staggered.
Scene 3 (3.8–6.357s): the two action cards resolve and hold as the still end-card; one solid cobalt `cta-button` ("Open the case study · live demo") sits centered beneath on the last cue ("decision by decision" ≈4.9–6.2s); at most **subtle jitter** (`sine-wave-loop`) keeps the rings ambient. Final frame — the only frame with a true exit hold. Progress bar reaches full.

## Selected blueprint: titlecard-reveal

# titlecard-reveal — Title-Card / Single-Card Reveal

**intent**: The calm breather/landing beat — one clean title or single brand/proof card revealed with exactly one restrained move (a slide-up crossfade, or a wipe-away-to-reveal), then a still hold. Low motion is the payload, not a deficiency.

**roles served**

- Benefits (from `benefits-titlecard-crossfade`, #34): a calm two-line value title card — headline value line, then one slide-up crossfade to a qualifier/elaboration line that holds center.
- Social_Proof (from `social-proof-reveal-card`, #35): wipe a busy app-collage open away with one diagonal pill-sweep to reveal a clean brand lockup (icon + wordmark) plus a centered "loved by [N]+ [audience] teams" social-proof line that spring-settles and holds.
- CTA (from `hard-cut-card-stack-to-logo`): a monochrome end-card
  CHAIN — statement → CTA / availability line → brand wordmark/logo — separated by instant hard
  cuts at full opacity; each card is its own allocated stillness, and the sequence terminates on
  the logo held to the final frame.
- Product_Intro (from `title-card-prelude-chain`): a three-beat dark title
  PRELUDE before any product UI — `[logo]` pop → `[name]` (a `[version]` appends grey→bright) →
  `[tagline]` card — chained by clears and blur-snap handoffs rather than hard cuts.

**duration**: 3–5s (Benefits 3–4s; Social_Proof ~5s / observed 4.7s). Card chains run 2–3s per
card, ~5.5–9.5s total.

**shot structure**

```
Scene 1 (0.0–~0.4s): static camera on [neutral / dark background]. Establish the opening state.
  Variant — Benefits: empty-to-text — [benefit line 1] is about to fade in centered (no busy open).
  Variant — Social_Proof: a busy intro frame holds briefly — an [app-screenshot / use-case collage] of overlapping cards under a [setup line].

Scene 2 (~0.4–~1.5s): the ONE move executes — a single restrained reveal that brings the calm card to center.
  Variant — Benefits: [benefit line 1] fades in centered while scaling slightly (~95%→100%, smooth ease-out) and holds.
  Variant — Social_Proof: a large [accent-color] rounded pill sweeps diagonally bottom-left → top-right and exits the corner, clip-path wiping the collage away to reveal the [brand logo lockup] beneath as the [logo icon] strokes draw on.

Scene 3 (~1.5s–end): the revealed/settled card holds to the end (the allocated stillness). At most one subtle live element (a slow breathing pulse on the card, or a very slow camera drift). No second development phase.
  Variant — Benefits: [benefit line 1] translates up and fades out as [benefit line 2 — qualifier / elaboration] translates up from below center and fades in to take center; holds. (This single slide-up crossfade IS the one move — Benefits front-loads no Scene-2 wipe.)
  Variant — Social_Proof: the lockup — [logo icon] centered, [wordmark] below, centered [social-proof tagline] "Loved by [N]+ [audience] teams" (the [N]+ may count up) — spring-settles small, then holds.

Variant — card chain (CTA end-card stack / Product_Intro title prelude): the single-card contract
repeats 2–3 times in sequence. Each card is a complete Scene 1–3 in miniature — arrive (or simply
BE there), at most one restrained move, hold — and the seams between cards are INSTANT hard cuts
at full opacity (no crossfade, no fade-through-black) or, in the prelude flavor, a blur-away →
snap-into-focus handoff.
  Card moves stay on budget: a character-by-character type-on with visible partial states, a
  right-to-left backspace that resolves the [wordmark] into the small [logo icon], a grey→bright
  append ("[name]" gains "[version]"), a blur-snap into focus — or nothing beyond a
  barely-perceptible continuous slow scale-up across the hold.
  The final card is always the [brand logo / lockup], held static to the last frame.
```

**motion vocabulary**: single restrained reveal (gentle fade-in + subtle scale-up settle | diagonal clip-path pill-wipe), one slide-up crossfade between two centered lines (Benefits), icon stroke draw-on (Social_Proof), optional "[N]+ teams" count-up, logo+tagline spring-settle-and-hold, subtle breathing on the held card, hold-to-end. Calm register — no spring chains, no tumble, no per-beat flips, no second phase. Camera static (optional very slow drift only). Card-chain register: instant hard cut at full opacity as the only seam, barely-perceptible
continuous slow scale-up across each hold, character-by-character type-on with visible partial
states, right-to-left backspace collapsing the wordmark into the logo icon, grey→bright text
append, blur-away → snap-into-focus card handoff, logo pop with overshoot + glow (prelude opener),
monochrome text-on-solid throughout.

**rule mapping**

- gentle fade-in + subtle scale-up settle (Benefits Scene 2) → `rules/scale-swap-transition.md` (restrained in/settle; cross-reference the fade ease in `techniques.md`)
- single slide-up crossfade between two centered lines (Benefits Scene 3) → `rules/discrete-text-sequence.md` (one line hands off to the next; translate-up + crossfade)
- diagonal pill-wipe reveal (Social_Proof Scene 2) → `rules/techniques.md` (clip-path reveal masks — the wipe)
- icon stroke draw-on (Social_Proof Scene 2) → `rules/svg-path-draw.md`
- "[N]+ teams" count-up (Social_Proof Scene 3, optional) → `rules/counting-dynamic-scale.md`
- logo + tagline spring-settle-and-hold (Social_Proof Scene 3) → `rules/spring-pop-entrance.md` (single soft settle; intentionally one beat, not a chain)
- subtle breathing on the held card (the one live element during the hold) → `rules/sine-wave-loop.md`
- type-on / backspace / grey→bright append (chain cards) → `rules/discrete-text-sequence.md`
  (non-linear typing incl. backspace; drive the version append as a bulk addition)
- wordmark remainder resolves into the logo icon → `rules/scale-swap-transition.md` (same-center
  swap fired as the last character deletes)
- barely-perceptible slow scale-up across a hold → the camera-modifier drift
  (`rules/multi-phase-camera.md`, micro-drift register) applied per-card
- blur-away → snap-into-focus handoff (prelude flavor) → `rules/depth-of-field-blur.md` (single
  pull on the outgoing / incoming card)
- logo pop with overshoot + glow (prelude card 1) → `rules/spring-pop-entrance.md` +
  `rules/ambient-glow-bloom.md`
- instant hard cut at full opacity → not a rule: a timeline `tl.set` swap — deliberately NO
  transition entry.

**camera modifier**: optional — a single very slow drift/push under the hold only → `rules/multi-phase-camera.md`. Default is fully static; do not add unless the held beat would otherwise read as a freeze-frame.

**stillness note**: This is a legitimate allocated-stillness beat. The hold in Scene 3 is the deliverable, not an unanimated gap — do NOT manufacture a development phase, extra swaps, or force-animation. One restrained move + a subtle hold (optionally one breathing element or one slow drift) is the correct and complete shape. The card-chain variant does not break this: each card individually obeys the one-move + hold
contract, and the hard cut is a seam, not a move. Boundary: if the cards flip at sub-second tempo
or each beat carries its own entrance/exit energy, you have left this blueprint — that is
`kinetic-type-beats` (its CTA variant owns the high-tempo value-line stack).

# Sine Wave Loop (subtle jitter / bounded ambient)

> **Reach for this last.** Per the motion doctrine (`references/motion-language.md`): circular breathing — scaling text/cards up and down to look "alive" — is cheap, the agent's reflexive cheat, and reads weak. "I'd rather have NO motion than BAD motion." First fill the back of a shot with **sequential reveal timed to the VO**; if a frame has genuinely settled and still needs life, the **sanctioned move is subtle jitter** — this rule at the LOW end of its amplitude range. A full breathing loop is the rare last resort on a single held hero, never stamped on every element.

Keeps a settled element from feeling dead using `Math.sin` on the timeline clock. Two forms:

- **Yoyo form** — one `sine.inOut` tween with `yoyo: true` and a **finite** `repeat` count. Preferred when the idle stands alone on a property nothing else touches.
- **onUpdate form** — one long `ease: "none"` tween drives a `phase` proxy `0 → 2π·CYCLES`; `onUpdate` maps `Math.sin(phase)` into the transform. Required when the offset multiplies/adds onto another live value (compound transforms, amplitude envelopes, multi-octave).

Either way, idle begins where the entry settled: at `phase = 0`, `sin(0) = 0` — the offset is zero, so there is no jump from the entry's resting state.

## Recipe

```js
// onUpdate form — phase-driven, composable.
const phase = { p: 0 };
tl.to(
  phase,
  {
    p: Math.PI * 2 * CYCLES,
    duration: IDLE_DUR,
    ease: "none", // sine provides the easing; a non-linear phase tween distorts the wave
    onUpdate: () => {
      const s = Math.sin(phase.p);
      hero.style.transform = `translateY(${s * Y_AMP_PX}px) scale(${1 + s * SCALE_AMP})`;
      // secondary elements: offset by Math.PI / 2 — synced motion looks mechanical
      dot.style.transform = `scale(${1 + Math.sin(phase.p + Math.PI / 2) * DOT_SCALE_AMP})`;
    },
  },
  IDLE_START_TIME,
);

// Yoyo form — standalone property, finite repeats.
tl.to(
  "#badge",
  { y: -Y_AMP_PX, duration: PERIOD / 2, ease: "sine.inOut", yoyo: true, repeat: REPEATS },
  IDLE_START_TIME,
);
```

## Variations

- **Multi-octave** (organic): stack a higher-frequency overlay — `1 + Math.sin(p) * AMP_PRIMARY + Math.sin(p * OCTAVE_RATIO) * AMP_SECONDARY`, with `AMP_SECONDARY < AMP_PRIMARY` and the combined max inside the normal SCALE_AMP range.
- **Settle and fade** (strongly recommended when `IDLE_DUR > 6s`): ramp amplitude to zero over the last ~20% of idle so the scene visibly settles before the inter-scene transition, instead of handing off mid-drift:

```js
const t = phase.p / (Math.PI * 2 * CYCLES); // 0 → 1 across idle
const env = t < 1 - FADE_FRAC ? 1 : (1 - t) / FADE_FRAC; // FADE_FRAC ≈ 0.2
const scale = 1 + Math.sin(phase.p) * SCALE_AMP * env;
```

This is the single biggest fix when finalize snapshots show "everything's still moving at the end"; it pairs naturally with break-boundary transitions (the outgoing visual is static when the crossfade/push begins).

## Critical Constraints

- **Prefer reveal, then jitter, then breath** — the doctrine order above; default to the LOW end of every amplitude range. At the upper end across 5+ consecutive scenes the whole film reads as "shimmering".
- **Long idle window** (`IDLE_DUR > 6s` OR idle > 30% of composition): halve `SCALE_AMP` / `Y_AMP_PX`, slow the period to 3–4s, and add the settle-and-fade tail.
- **Concurrent idle on N elements** (columns, card grid, stat row): per-element amplitude ≤ default `/ √N`, AND stagger the periods (2.1s / 1.9s / 2.4s). Three columns at ±6px compound to ±18px of competing motion; three at ±2–3px read as one collective breath.
- **Compose, don't replace** — idle ADDS to the element's resting transform; never overwrite the entry's final translation.
- **Phase tween `ease: "none"`** — sine itself is the curve.
- **No CSS `@keyframes` for idle** — CSS animation runs on the browser's render clock, independent of the HF seek clock; a CSS-driven idle flickers/desyncs. Drive idle inside the timeline.

# Spring-Pop Entrance

> **Smooth beats bouncy.** This entrance defaults to a smooth long-tail settle — `power3.out` (or `expo.out` for a faster front) — that decelerates cleanly into the resting size with **no overshoot**. Bouncy `back.out` is the **#1 instant turn-off** in agent-made videos and is almost never executed well; it is a rare, explicitly-playful exception (consumer / fun brand), never the default. When unsure, settle smoothly.

THE entrance primitive: an element (or staggered group) arrives by springing from nothing — `scale: 0 → 1`, optional small `y` rise — and settles without bouncing. This is **arrival**, not reaction: distinct from [press-release-spring.md](press-release-spring.md) (a click/press → release feedback chain on an element that already rests on screen). Many blueprints used to borrow that rule to fake an entrance; reach for this instead.

## How It Works

One `fromTo` carries the whole arrival: from `{ scale: 0, opacity: 0 }` (explicit, so t=0 is correct under seek) to `{ scale: 1, opacity: 1, ease: "power3.out" }`. For a **group**, the same `fromTo` runs per element at `i * STAGGER`, capped so the group reads as one arriving beat. The `scale` grow is load-bearing; the `y` rise is garnish — drop everything else and it must still read as a clean entrance. Let the ease produce the settle: never hand-key a `scale: 1.1` mid-state (it double-bounces against the curve).

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="pop-hero" id="hero">{heroLabel}</div>

<div class="pop-grid">
  <div class="pop-item">{itemA}</div>
  <div class="pop-item">{itemB}</div>
  <div class="pop-item">{itemC}</div>
</div>
```

```css
.pop-hero,
.pop-item {
  transform-origin: 50% 50%; /* in-place pop; move to the source point for the anchored variation */
  will-change: transform;
}
.pop-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  gap: GRID_GAP;
  place-items: center;
}
```

```js
// Single hero pop — smooth long-tail settle, no overshoot.
tl.fromTo(
  "#hero",
  { scale: 0, opacity: 0 },
  { scale: 1, opacity: 1, duration: POP_DUR, ease: "power3.out" },
  ENTRY_AT,
);

// Staggered group pop — one arriving beat.
gsap.utils.toArray(".pop-item").forEach((el, i) => {
  tl.fromTo(
    el,
    { scale: 0, opacity: 0, y: Y_RISE },
    { scale: 1, opacity: 1, y: 0, duration: POP_DUR, ease: "power3.out" },
    GROUP_ENTRY_AT + i * STAGGER,
  );
});
```

## Variations

- **Calm settle** (premium / enterprise): `power3.out`, no rotation, `Y_RISE` 0–12px — a weighted, confident landing for a hero wordmark or product shot.
- **Firm settle** (everyday default): `power3.out` or `expo.out` for a punchier front, `Y_RISE` ~24px — cards, icons, callouts.
- **Exact-physics settle**: when the settle IS the shot, swap the ease for `springEase({ response: 0.4 })` (critically damped) from `../adapters/gsap-easing-and-stagger.md` → Spring Eases; take `duration` from the helper.
- **Origin-anchored pop**: a callout growing out of a specific point (marker, pointer tip) sets `transform-origin` to that point (e.g. `0% 100%`) so `scale: 0 → 1` reads as "emerging from the source", not "inflating in place".
- **Pop into a held slot**: land the pop and hold still — no idle loop baked into the entrance. If the held frame genuinely needs life, hand off to [sine-wave-loop.md](sine-wave-loop.md) for subtle jitter on a separate later tween; prefer revealing the next element on its VO cue.
- **Bouncy pop (RARE — explicitly-playful only)**: swap the ease for `back.out(OVERSHOOT)` and optionally settle a small `rotation: ROT_FROM → 0` so elements look hand-placed. Only for a deliberately playful register — never product / enterprise / serious tone:

```js
tl.fromTo(
  el,
  { scale: 0, opacity: 0, rotation: ROT_FROM },
  { scale: 1, opacity: 1, rotation: 0, duration: POP_DUR, ease: `back.out(${OVERSHOOT})` },
  GROUP_ENTRY_AT + i * STAGGER,
);
```

Even here keep `OVERSHOOT ≤ ~2` — past that it reads as cartoon wobble. Better still: the baked spring at `dampingFraction: 0.6–0.7` (same adapters doc) gives ~5–10% overshoot that reads physical where `back.out` reads cartoon.

| ITEM_COUNT | 3–9                                       | >9 makes the stagger vanish — switch to a wipe/sweep reveal      |
| Y_RISE     | 0–32px                                    | small; never large enough to read as a slide-up                  |
| ROT_FROM   | −10°–+10°                                 | playful variant only; alternate sign by index (`i % 2 ? 6 : -6`) |
| ENTRY_AT   | 0–0.4s                                    | a beat of quiet, but keep the subject landing by t ≤ 0.5s        |

## Critical Constraints

- Default ease `power3.out` (no overshoot); `back.out` only in the explicitly-playful variant, and there `OVERSHOOT ≤ ~2`.
- `ITEM_COUNT × STAGGER ≤ ~0.5s` — the group must land inside one beat.
- Entrances state the collapsed from-state in `fromTo` — never rely on a CSS-hidden start (it renders visible before the tween claims it under seek).
- `transform-origin: 50% 50%` for an in-place pop; the source point only for the anchored variation.
- This is a finite arrival — idle motion on a held element is a separate, later `sine-wave-loop` tween.

# Waterfall Entry

Staggered ARRIVAL cascade: words/elements whip in from below (one consistent direction),
each starting before the previous settles — an accelerating wave that resolves into a
composed layout. Title cards, segment openers, list/feature intros.

**This is an in-scene arrival, not a seam.** Its seam sibling is the waterfall CUT
(`cut-the-curve` doctrine skill, `seams/waterfall-cut.md`); do not mix their rules:

|               | Entry (this rule — arrival)                   | Waterfall Cut (seam)                                      |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Opacity       | BINARY 0→1 via `tl.set` at entry — never fade | ignites at 0.35 mid-path — the fade IS the velocity trick |
| Axis default  | Y, from below                                 | X, riding the current                                     |
| Outgoing side | none                                          | words ramp out on mirrored power4.in                      |

## Choreography

- **Overlap, don't queue** — next element starts within ±2 frames of the previous
  settling; gaps SHRINK across the cascade; the last element snaps.
- **Velocity varies by weight** — heavy/anchor elements travel further and longer;
  light words/punctuation snap in tight:

| Parameter | Anchor/heavy | Normal word | Light/punctuation |
| --------- | ------------ | ----------- | ----------------- |
| Y offset  | 60–80px      | 40–50px     | 30–48px           |
| Duration  | 0.16–0.20s   | 0.13–0.16s  | 0.10–0.13s        |
| Overlap   | 0–2f gap     | 1f overlap  | 1–2f overlap      |

- Ease `power4.out` (`expo.out` for extra snap); never `.inOut` on an entry.
- One direction per cascade.
- Split the FINAL word into fragments to extend the climax; fragments travel further.
- Post-settle, the group usually slides to make room for the next beat — that's
  [nudge-curve.md](nudge-curve.md).

## JS

Each element: `tl.set` (instant reveal + offset) then `tl.to` (whip to rest).
`nextStart = prevStart + prevDuration − (overlapFrames × F)`; +overlap = cascade,
−overlap = deliberate gap. CSS: elements start `opacity: 0; display: inline-block`.

```js
var F = 1 / 60;
var t0 = 0.1;
// anchor (heaviest): biggest travel, longest settle
tl.set("#el-1", { opacity: 1, y: 80 }, t0);
tl.to("#el-1", { y: 0, duration: 0.18, ease: "power4.out" }, t0);
// normal word: 2 frames after the anchor finishes
var t1 = t0 + 0.18 + 2 * F;
tl.set("#el-2", { opacity: 1, y: 45 }, t1);
tl.to("#el-2", { y: 0, duration: 0.15, ease: "power4.out" }, t1);
// light word: 1 frame BEFORE the previous finishes (overlap)
var t2 = t1 + 0.15 - F;
tl.set("#el-3", { opacity: 1, y: 40 }, t2);
tl.to("#el-3", { y: 0, duration: 0.14, ease: "power4.out" }, t2);
// split final-word fragments: tightest overlap, extra travel (lighter)
var t3 = t2 + 0.14 - F;
tl.set("#frag-a", { opacity: 1, y: 70 }, t3);
tl.to("#frag-a", { y: 0, duration: 0.16, ease: "power4.out" }, t3);
var t4 = t3 + 0.14 - F;
tl.set("#frag-b", { opacity: 1, y: 70 }, t4);
tl.to("#frag-b", { y: 0, duration: 0.15, ease: "power4.out" }, t4);
// punctuation: lightest, fastest
var t5 = t4 + 0.13 - 2 * F;
tl.set("#dot", { opacity: 1, y: 48 }, t5);
tl.to("#dot", { y: 0, duration: 0.12, ease: "power4.out" }, t5);
```

## Anti-patterns

| Don't                                                  | Instead                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Queued entries (each waits for the previous to settle) | Overlap ±1–2 frames — the cascade is a wave, not a queue                          |
| Same offset/duration for every cascade element         | Vary by weight: anchors travel further, punctuation snaps                         |
| Gradual opacity fade on an arrival                     | Binary 0→1 via `tl.set` — fading fights the snap (seam cuts fade; arrivals don't) |
